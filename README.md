Implement two data structures and compare their performance.

1. Create a "Pair" structure for calculus, which has the following fields: teacher's name, lesson number, number of attending students.

2. Implement a dynamic array:
2.1 Create a "DynamicArray" structure for storing structures according to your variant and implement the basic functions of a dynamic array:
push_back() – add an element to the end
pop_back() – read and remove an element from the end
get() – read the n-th element
size() – find the number of elements
print() – print all elements with stored data
clear() – delete all elements and free memory
2.2 Implement additional functions for the dynamic array:
push_front() – add an element to the beginning
pop_front() – read and remove an element from the beginning

3. Implement a singly linked list:
3.1 Create a "Node" structure for the basic element of a singly linked list, which will contain a structure according to your variant.
3.2 Create a "LinkedList" structure and implement the basic functions of a singly linked list:
push_front() – add an element to the beginning
push_back() – add an element to the end
get() – read the n-th element
pop_front() – read and remove an element from the beginning
pop_back() – read and remove an element from the end
size() – find the number of elements
print() – print all elements with stored data
clear() – delete all elements and free memory

4. Think about implementing the methods insert() and remove() for adding and removing the n-th element in both the dynamic array and singly linked list, compare their asymptotics, and possible execution times. Implementation is optional.

5. Compare the performance of the dynamic array and singly linked list (perform each step for both structures, measure and compare the time for each step and all steps together):
5.1 Add 50,000 elements to the end.
5.2 Add 10,000 elements to the beginning.
5.3 Read 20,000 elements with random indices.
5.4 Remove 5,000 elements from the beginning.
5.5 Remove 5,000 elements from the end.

Also GitHub has some issues with Cyrillic symbols, therefore, some comments and lines of code may not be displayed correctly.
